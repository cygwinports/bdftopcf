CATEGORY="X11"
SUMMARY="X bitmap font compiler"
DESCRIPTION="Bdftopcf is a font compiler for the X server and font server.
Fonts in Portable Compiled Format can be read by any architecture, although the
file is structured to allow one particular architecture to read them directly
without reformatting. This allows fast reading on the appropriate machine, but
the files are still portable on other machines."
